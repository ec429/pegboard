PEGBoARD (Parallel EiGht Bit ARchitecture Design) is an architecture for a
 Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) machine using the Z80 CPU.
PEGASuS (Parallel EiGht Bit Architecture System Simulator) is an emulator for
 a PEGBoARD machine.
PEGBOx (Parallel EiGht Bit Os) is a pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system
 for PEGBoARD machines.
PECULIAR (PEgbox Core Userland LIbrARy) will be the run-time library for PEGBOx
 user processes, but its development hasn't been started yet.

== pegboard ==
The PEGBoARD architecture is (loosely) specified in 'arch-spec'.  It is expected
 that the architecture will continue to evolve as development of the operating
 system continues; features known to be missing from the architecture include
 inter-processor interrupts (IPIs), and page protection bits in the MMU.

== pegasus ==
The PEGASuS emulator is licensed under the GNU GPL v3+.  A copy of the GPLv3
 appears in the file 'COPYING'.  pegasus's Z80 core was derived from that of the
 'Spiffy' ZX Spectrum emulator <https://github.com/ec429/spiffy>.

== pegbox ==
The PEGBOx kernel can be found in the pegbox/ subdirectory; the kernel binary
 will be built to pegbox/kernel.bin.  PEGBOx is licensed under the GNU GPL v2
 (see pegbox/COPYING), though note that this does *not* cover user programs that
 use PEGBOx kernel services by normal system calls - this is merely considered
 normal use of the kernel, and does NOT fall under the heading of derived work.

== peculiar ==
Development of the PECULIAR library hasn't been started yet, probably because
 the PEGBOx kernel doesn't have a system call mechanism yet.  In fact, we can't
 even run user programs because there's no defined executable format nor a
 loader/dynamic linker for it.
When it is developed, it will probably be licensed under the GNU LGPL.
